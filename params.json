{"name":"WB Collect","tagline":"Web Bomic Events Collection","body":"## Web Bomic Collect\r\nAllows collection of Web Bomic client events via IPad or Android devices, that can be synchronised to any Web Bomic application.\r\n\r\n## Installing Web Bomic Collect\r\nWB Collect is made of 3 parts that need to be installed separately.\r\n\r\n* A SQL Script that adds a pin number field to the users table (USRS_DAT) in Web Bomic.\r\n* A Web API interface that fetches and posts data into Web Bomic.\r\n* A IPad or Android App that allows the collection of the events.\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
